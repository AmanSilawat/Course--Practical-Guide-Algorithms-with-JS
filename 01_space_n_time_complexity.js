What is an algorithm?
algorithm is just the step that you take to solve the problem.

** Time Complexity **
 
Space complexity
    how much memory us used?

Time complexity
    How many primitive poerations are executed?

...with respect to input size
...and assuming worst case scenarios


constant    O(1)        SUPER FAST
logarithmic O(log n)        |
liner       O(n)            |
quadratic   O(n^2)          ·êØ
exponential O(k^n)     SUPER SLOW
